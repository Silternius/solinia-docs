**INSTALLING THE MOD FOR FALL OF AN EMPIRE**

NOTE: You require the latest version of forge to run the mod and play on our server.

Please download forge for your version of minecraft at https://files.minecraftforge.net/

Once downloaded, open the forge.jar file and run the installer. When it prompts you, choose "client".

You can then install our mod in your .minecraft directory

Our mod is available from https://github.com/mixxit/solinia3-ui/releases

Please download the solinia3ui-1.14.4.jar file, not the source code (zip / tar.gz).

To get to your .minecraft directory, press CTRL + R and type %appdata%\.minecraft and press enter.

Then place the mod in your "mods" folder. If there is no "mods" folder, create one and place the mod inside.

Congratulations! You should be all set and ready to start playing on our server!

Please exit Minecraft and restart it and you should be able to log on.
